# mTSP_ACO
This repository contains source code for the four investigated Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithms for the bi-objective Multiple Traveling Salesman Problem (multiple-TSP). For more details, see this paper "Necula, R., Breaban, M., Raschip, M.: Tackling the Bi-criteria Facet of Multiple Traveling Salesman Problem with Ant Colony Systems. ICTAI, (2015)". To have an overview of the performance of the investigated algorithms, the considered multiple-TSP instances were solved by exact methods using CPLEX optimization software. The obtained results are available online at this benchmark page: www.infoiasi.ro/~mtsplib.
